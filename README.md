The purpose of this project is to create a tracking app for their attendance at courses and laboratories/seminaries.

Situation: let's say that your university wants to give up on the well-known method of keeping on with the student's attendance in classes (each student writing his name on a piece of paper and at the end of the lesson the teacher reads out loud the names) because it's time-consuming and it gives the opportunity to mislead the number of attendance of a student. Each classroom would have a unique QR code for each subject, teacher, group of students, and hour. The student will scan the QR code with his smartphone, he will immediately be registered, and enter the classroom;  this way the teacher will have the list with all the names of the students and the time when the student entered the classroom.
